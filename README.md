# Coffee Shop Order Management System

## Overview

The **Coffee Shop Order Management System** project focuses on optimizing the workflow of a coffee shop through the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. By simulating the order management process, this project aims to enhance service efficiency, track popular beverages, and improve customer satisfaction.

### Objectives

1. **Class Design**: Develop a `Beverage` class as a blueprint for all drinks, encapsulating essential attributes and methods.
2. **Order Tracking**: Implement functionality to track orders in real-time, enabling efficient inventory management.
3. **Discount Application**: Create methods to apply discounts on beverages for promotions, enhancing customer engagement.
4. **Data Presentation**: Display beverage information in a user-friendly manner, making it easier for staff to assist customers.

## Methodology

- **Class Design**:
  - Defined a `Beverage` class with attributes such as `name`, `size`, and `price`. Each instance represents a specific beverage offered in the shop.

- **Order Tracking**:
  - Developed methods to track popular drinks and adjust stock levels dynamically based on customer orders, facilitating real-time inventory management.

- **Discount Application**:
  - Implemented the `apply_discount()` method to calculate and apply promotional discounts, ensuring competitive pricing and enhancing customer loyalty.

- **Data Presentation**:
  - Created the `display_info()` method to showcase beverage details in a clear format, allowing for quick reference during service.

## Skills Utilized

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Leveraged OOP concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, and methods to build a robust system.
- **Python Programming**: Developed the application using Python, emphasizing clean and efficient code structure.
- **Data Management**: Applied techniques for managing and displaying beverage data effectively.

## Findings

The implementation of the Coffee Shop Order Management System revealed several key insights:

- **Improved Efficiency**: Streamlined order processing, leading to faster service times and enhanced customer satisfaction.
- **Enhanced Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking of popular beverages allows for timely restocking and waste reduction.
- **Customer Engagement**: Implementing discount features encouraged repeat visits and increased customer loyalty.
